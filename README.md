# Up-Mia
This project is a comprehensive inter-departmental project between engineering and fine arts faculties.
 
There were a 3 coder, 2 reporter and 1 project manager which are all engineering students and 3 other person from fine arts faculty for visual design of the game.
I was one of the coders.
 
"Up Mia!" is a mobile game. It has kind a similar gameplay with "Doodle Jump" which is a well known endless jumping game.

Mia is the little girl who loves ice creams. In the gameplay you need to scroll up your finger to jump. While jumping on the bricks you will encounter with some ice creams.
These ice creams have different power-ups for Mia. There were 6 different ice creams;

-Evil: Bricks will start to move. 
-High jump: Provides Mia to jump higher.
-Health: Mia will gain a shield that prevent her to die if she fall down.
-Coin Magnet: Mia will gain a magnet to collect coins easily.
-Coin 2x: Coins gives double amount of gold.
-Jet Block: Brick starts to move upwards with her fastly.

Also game is going to be faster and faster if you do not fall down.

There is also a shop to buy new outfits for Mia to wear using collected coins.
